# Multi-Armed Bandit Implementation for Ad Banner Optimization

## Project Overview
This project implements an Epsilon-Greedy Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm to optimize ad banner selection. It simulates a scenario with 5 different ad banners and uses the MAB approach to balance exploration and exploitation in determining the most effective banner for user engagement.

## Problem Statement
When running a website with multiple ad banner variations, traditional A/B testing requires complete exploration before making decisions, leading to potential lost opportunities. This implementation demonstrates how Multi-Armed Bandits can more efficiently:
- Identify high-performing banners faster
- Reduce opportunity cost during testing
- Adapt banner selection based on real-time performance

## Implementation Details

### Data Simulation
- Creates a synthetic dataset (100,000 rows Ã— 5 banners)
- Each entry represents a user interaction (1 for click, 0 for no click)
- Simulates realistic ad banner performance scenarios

### Algorithm Components
```python
# Key Parameters
num_banner = 5                    # Number of different banners
no_of_iterations = 100000         # Total number of user interactions
epsilon = 0.5                     # Exploration-exploitation balance

## Features

- Implements Epsilon-Greedy strategy for banner selection
- Tracks performance metrics for each banner:

* Click counts
* Total rewards
* Average reward (Q-value)

- Balances exploration of new banners with exploitation of known performers

## Key Differences from A/B Testing

1. Adaptive Learning: Updates banner selection probabilities in real-time
2. Efficiency: Favors better-performing banners while still exploring alternatives
3. Flexibility: Can adjust to changing user preferences during the testing period

## Future Improvements

- Implement different MAB strategies (Thompson Sampling, UCB)
- Include decay factors for temporal changes in user preferences
- Add support for dynamic banner addition/removal
- Implement Contextual Bandits to consider:
  - User demographics (age, location, interests)
  - Time of day and seasonality
  - Device type and browser information
  - User browsing history and behavior
  - Previous interactions with similar ads
- Add feature engineering capabilities for contextual information
- Implement more sophisticated reward modeling based on context
- Add A/B testing comparison benchmarks
